# Bamazon-App

### Introduction
Bamazon is a multi-faceted CLI application that presents the user with a digital storefront. The app has both a 'Customer' view and a 'Manager' view, which allow the user to view and interact with products that are stored in a database. As a 'Customer', the user would access the bamazonCustomer.js file within their terminal using Node. They would then be able to either view all of the available products or make a purchase. As a 'Manager', the user would instead access the bamazonManager.js file in their terminal using Node. They would then be presented with a menu of options that allow the user to view and update the products in the database.  A 'Manager' can complete the following actions:

1. View Products for Sale
2. View Low Inventory
3. Add to Inventory
4. Add New Product
